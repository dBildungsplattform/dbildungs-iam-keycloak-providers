# DBILDUNGS-IAM-KEYCLOAK-PROVIDERS

This repository is designed for creating custom **providers** for our **dbildungs-iam-keycloak** instance. It serves as the foundation for extending Keycloak's functionality to meet our specific requirements, such as custom protocol mappers, event listeners, and other extensions.
